    """
    Break down a Scrall instance assignment statement into action semantics and populate them

    The lhs (left hand side) will be a labeled Instance Flow. It may or may not have an explicit Class Type.
    The card (cardinality) is either 1c or Mc (one or many conditional). It determines whether the lhs Instance
    Flow is Single or Multiple.

    The rhs (right hand side) is an expression that outputs an instance set of some Class Type. If the lhs is
    explicitly typed, we throw an exception if the rhs and lhs types do not match.

    For now we limit the expression to a chain of the following components:
        * create action
        * traversal action
        * instance flow
        * method or operation output of Class Type
        * selection output

    We say 'chain' since the output of one can feed into the input of the next yielding a final output at the end
    of the chain. It is this final output that determines the type (or type conflict) with the lhs Instance Flow

    We say 'for now' because this chain does not yet take into account instance set operations (add, subtract, union,
    etc). The Scrall syntax will later be udpated to accommodate such expressions.

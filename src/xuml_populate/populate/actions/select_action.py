        Determine whether we are selecting an instance of a Class based on an identifier match.

        There are two cases of identifier selection to consider each of which yields a single instance flow output.

        Normally, we select an instance using a supplied identifier. The identifier ensures that
        at most one instance will be selected. Here we verify that each attribute of some identifier of the target
        class is compared using the == operator to a supplied value.

        But there is a more nuancd case to consider where we traverse to a many associative class from
        a single instance of either participating class. We set the self.hop_to_many_assoc_from_one_instance
        boolean to true during initialization when this case is detected.

        The normal and nuanced cases are mutually exclusive.

        Let's examine both of these cases with examples from the Elevator Case Study class model.

        In the normal case, the user wants to select a single instance using an identifier for the associated class.

        Assume Floor, Shaft is an identifier defined on the Accessible Shaft Level class
        This means that if you supply a value for each identifier attribute like so

        Accessible Shaft Level( Floor == x, Shaft == y )

        you will select at most one instance. But if you select based on only part of an identifier:

        Accessible Shaft Level( Shaft == y )

        you may select multiple instances since a Shaft intersects multiple Floors.

        The nuanced case applies when we select from a many associative class and when we have traversed to that class
        from a single participating instance flow. With a one associative class, this traversal will always direct us
        to at most a single instance without the specification of any identifier values. But the many associative case,
        by its very nature, leaves open the possibility of multiple instances. To narrow down to a single instance, the
        user must supply a value for each identifier attribute that is NOT itself a referential attribute formalizing
        the many associative relationship.

        For example, let's say that the user traverses from a single instance of Accessible Shaft Level,
        which happens to be a participating class on a many associative relationship. This relationship is
        formalized by the Floor Service class, which uses its non-referential 'Direction' identifier attribute to
        discriminate between an up or down call direction.

        If the Floor Service instance is selected using the == comparison on that 'Direction' attribute, we know
        that at most one instance will be selected. This is because the 'Direction' attribute is part of an Identifier,
        actually it is part of two Identifiers! But one is enough. It turns out that all of the other attributes of
        either of these two Identifiers are referential attributes formalizing the many associative relationship.

        Returns:
            In either case, normal or nuanced, we'll return the lowest numbered identifier that satisfies
                the condition. If the identity selection criteria is not met, we'll return 0 to indicate
                that no identifier match was found.

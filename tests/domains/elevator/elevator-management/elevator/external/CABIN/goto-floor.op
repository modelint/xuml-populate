// This operation is implemented in the Transport domain. The output flow
// represents the success or failure status of the floor service request. If it is
// physically impossible to make a safe stop at the requested destination, false is
// returned with no physical effect. If the request can be satisfied, true is returned
// and the requested transport is commanded and controlled.

// STUB: The Transport domain has not yet been developed this operation
// serves as a stub. True is always returned with no physical effect.
